# EazyWii

Barebones instructions for getting these sweet sweet, totally legit wbfs copies of Wii games, on a real Wii (and not mini).

Some copypasting happened from here: https://wii.guide

Requirements: python3

How to run: either make the script executable (unix) and run it, or just do `python eazywii.py`. Then follow instructions.
